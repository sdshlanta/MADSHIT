# General Hospital Secure Heart Information Transmitter

This document is meant to give a basic overview of the Secure Heart Information Transmitter system.  The Secure Heart Information Transmitter a device undergoing medical trials here at General Hospital and is designed to help improve patient outcomes by alerting doctors whenever it detects a change in the condition of a patientâ€™s heart.  As the device is currently undergoing medical trials frequent testing of the device may be performed by staff to ensure it is functioning properly.

The Secure Heart Information Transmitter is broken up into three main components.  These are the Hardware Action Reporting Device, the reporting database, and the Alarm Database Interface Connector.  The specific function of each component is detailed below.

The executeable files for the Secure Heart Information Transmitter are located in `/home/pi/MADSHIT/MADSHIT`.
